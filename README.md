John and Mike both play basketball in different teams. In the latest 3 games, John's team scored 89, 120 and 103 points, 
while Mike's team scored 116, 94 and 123 points.

    1. Calculate the average score for each team.
    2. Decide which team has the highest average score, and print the winner to the console. Include the 
    average score in the output.
    3. Then change the scores to show different winners. Don't forget to take into account there might be a draw 
    (the same average score)
